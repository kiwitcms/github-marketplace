Introduction
------------

This package provides the marketplace/payment integration for the
`Kiwi TCMS multi-tenant SaaS <https://kiwitcms.org/#subscriptions>`_.
Everyting that we do is open and that's why this piece of code is
open source as well. You don't need this add-on in order to run Kiwi TCMS!


Installation
------------

    pip install kiwitcms-github-marketplace


Configuration
-------------

Required settings:

- ``KIWI_GITHUB_MARKETPLACE_SECRET`` - binary string
- ``KIWI_FASTSPRING_SECRET`` - binary string
- ``QUAY_IO_TOKEN`` - string
- ``MAILCHIMP_USERNAME`` - string
- ``MAILCHIMP_SECRET`` - string

Product configuration
---------------------

- Subscriptions on FastSpring use the SKU field to define access to private
  docker repositories. The format is ``repo_name1+repo_name2``, where
  ``https://quay.io/kiwitcms/<repo_name>`` exists
- FastSpring SKUs starting with "x-" are considered special and we don't
  treat them as docker repository names
- Plans on GitHub Marketplace use one of their bullet items to define access
  to private docker repositories. Format is
  ``Docker repositories: quay.io/kiwitcms/<repo1>, quay.io/kiwitcms/<repo2>``
