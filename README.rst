Introduction
------------

This package provides the GitHub Marketplace integration for the
`Kiwi TCMS multi-tenant SaaS <https://github.com/marketplace/kiwi-tcms>`_.
Everyting that we do is open and that's why this piece of code is
open source as well. You don't need this add-on in order to run Kiwi TCMS!
